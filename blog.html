  <h1 align="center">My coding Journey</h1>
  <br>
  <p>I started this page of my site in August 2023 to make a blog to catalog my progress in the course I was taking as well as how things continue after that. It was a long journey but after over 200 hours and several project I was able to complete the course and proudly graduate from the program.</p>
  <p>Since completing the class I took I have continued to learn new parts of coding and created several new and creative projects such as a chat bot app that uses an API to give detailed responses and even a website for my kids to list crafts items they create to sell locally.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Along my journey I also came to realize how much I enjoy working with coding and computers and that maybe this is the carrer path I should look at following. My goal is to one day be able to create websites and wewb applications that will have an impact on how businesses can interact with their customers effectively. On the portfolio page linked above you can view projects that I have completed as well as project I' am currently working on.
  In the future I plan to add a sign up form and even a registration page to my site to enable update emails to be sent out as new projects are created and also as I updsate this page with new progress along this journey.</p>
